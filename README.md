When I took a QA course, I had some free time and decided to use it to learn a little computer graphics.

We were not allowed to download anything on the computer, so I used this opportunity to learn about how the OpenGL pipeline works, and emulate parts of it using the Windows API.

This is the resulting project. It's very slow, very bad, and far from complete, but it was a nice learning experience.
